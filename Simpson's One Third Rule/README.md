Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm
=======================

This algorithm utilizes Simpson's 1/3 Rule to estimate an integral. If
there are an odd number of segments, Simpson's 1/3 Rule is used for all
the segments except the last. The numercal integration of the last
segment is estimated by the trapezoid rule.
