# Mech105Algorithms
A collection of the algorithms I wrote in Mech105: Numerical Methods (Spring 2021)

List of Algorithms: 
* Binary Converter
* False Position
* LU Factorization with partial pivoting
* Simpson's 1/3 Rule

This is **bold** and *italics*.

# Binary Converter
*This algorithm takes in a base 10 number and converts it to binary*

# False Position
*This algorithm uses the root finding technique of false position. A function, lower estimate and upper estimate are required*
