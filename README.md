# Mech105Algorithms
A collection of the algorithms I wrote in Mech105: Numerical Methods (Spring 2021)

List of Algorithms: 
* Binary Converter
* False Position
* LU Factorization with partial pivoting
* Simpson's 1/3 Rule


# Binary Converter
*This algorithm takes in a base 10 number and converts it to binary.*

# False Position
*This algorithm uses the root finding technique of false position. A function, lower estimate and upper estimate are required.*

# LU Factorization
*This algorithm takes in a coefficient matrix and then uses LU Factorization with partial pivoting to output the lower (L), upper (U), and pivot (P) matrices.* 

# Simpson's 1/3 Rule
*This algorithm utilizes Simpson's 1/3 Rule for an even number of segments. If an odd number of segments is input, the algorithm uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule until the last segment, at which point the trapezoid rule is used.*
